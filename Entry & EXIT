Test Execution Report: Entry Criteria
reason:
It is not an Entry Criteria because Entry Criteria are the conditions that must be met before testing begins, whereas the Test Execution Report is generated after testing is complete.
Test Execution Report:
The Test Execution Report is an Exit Criteria deliverable.
Reason:
The Test Execution Report is generated after test execution is complete, summarizing the results, including pass/fail status, defects found, and test coverage. 
This report provides stakeholders with a clear understanding of the testing outcome and any defects or issues that need attention.

Why Exit Criteria?
1. Post-testing: The report is generated after testing is complete.
2. Summarizes results: It provides a summary of test execution results, defects, and test coverage.
3. Stakeholder awareness: It informs stakeholders about the testing outcome and any issues.
